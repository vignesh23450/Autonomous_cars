# **Autonomous Vehicle with Monocular Camera and Deep Learning**

This project implements a low-cost autonomous vehicle system using a monocular camera and deep learning techniques. The system is designed for real-time lane detection, object detection, and distance estimation using the Raspberry Pi 4B and Pi Camera. The primary goal is to provide an affordable alternative to expensive sensor-based autonomous systems, making it more accessible to a wider audience.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to develop a monocular camera-based autonomous vehicle system capable of:
1. Detecting lane boundaries in real-time.
2. Identifying and classifying obstacles in the vehicle's path.
3. Estimating distances to detected objects for dynamic navigation adjustments.
4. Controlling the vehicle’s motor based on lane detection and object proximity.

The project uses OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for object detection, integrated with Raspberry Pi’s GPIO for motor control.

## **Features**
- **Lane Detection**: Detects lane lines using computer vision algorithms (Canny edge detection, Hough transform).
- **Object Detection**: Real-time object detection and classification using a pre-trained deep learning model (COCO dataset).
- **Distance Estimation**: Estimates the distance between the vehicle and detected objects.
- **Motor Control**: Adjusts vehicle speed and direction based on lane deviation and object proximity.

## **Hardware Requirements**
- **Raspberry Pi 4B** (or equivalent)
- **Pi Camera Module V2** (8MP)
- **L298N Motor Driver** with DC Motors
- **5V/3A Power Supply** (for Raspberry Pi)
- **12V Power Supply** (for motors)
- **SG90 Servo Motors** (for steering control)
- **HDMI Display** (for monitoring)

## **Software Requirements**
- **Operating System**: Raspbian OS
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.7+
- **Libraries**: 
  - OpenCV
  - TensorFlow
  - NumPy
  - RPi.GPIO
  - Picamera

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autonomous-vehicle-monocular-camera.git
   cd autonomous-vehicle-monocular-camera
   ```


   

2. **Set up Raspberry Pi Camera**:
   Ensure that the Pi Camera is enabled:
   ```bash
   sudo raspi-config
   ```
   Navigate to **Interface Options** and enable the camera.

3. **Run the system**:
   Start the lane detection and object detection system:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## **Usage**

- **Lane Detection**: The system will display real-time video with detected lane lines highlighted in green. It will also show lane deviation in the vehicle's trajectory.
- **Object Detection**: Detected objects will be highlighted with bounding boxes and classified with labels (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles).
- **Motor Control**: The vehicle will adjust its speed and direction based on the proximity of objects and lane deviation.

To stop the system, press `Ctrl + C`.

## **Test Results**

During testing, the following key metrics were observed:
- **Lane Detection Accuracy**: 90% in normal lighting conditions.
- **Object Detection Accuracy**: 90% with real-time performance.
- **Distance Estimation Accuracy**: ±3 cm for objects 30-50 cm away.
